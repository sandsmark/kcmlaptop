ksmlaptop v0.7
Paul Campbell <paul@taniwha.com>

WHAT?
-----
kcmlaptop - laptop control panel for KDE - including battery monitor and suspend control

HOW?
----
... do I install it?

   In short:

   % ./configure
   % make
   % make install

   Battery uses the standard KDE apps framework so it should compile and
   install like any other KDE app.  See the INSTALL file for more
   information.

   Battery should work equally fine with either KDE 1.0 or KDE 1.1.  

   This replaces 'battery' - if you previously installed
   it remove it be executing:

	rm -f /opt/kde/share/applnk/Utilities/battery.kdelnk
	rm -f /opt/kde/bin/battery
	rm -rf /opt/kde/share/apps/battery

BUGS
----
I don't know of any - I'm sure they're there - let me know 
I'll fix them.

Enjoy!
Paul
