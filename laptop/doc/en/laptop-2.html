You must also have the kernel APM package installed in your kernel.

<P>Compiling kcmlaptop is very easy. First make sure you have KDE and the QQT
libraries installed The following should do it:

<P>If you want the 'suspend' and 'standby' menu commands to work then you should
install the Linux apmd package (version 2.4 or later). If you want to use
them from non-root accounts you must mark the 'apm' command 'set uid root'.
To do this log on as root and enter:
<HR>
<PRE>
        chown root /usr/bin/apm;chmod +s /usr/bin/apm

<P>If you had previously installed my battery utility you should uninstall 
it using the following commands.

<HR>
<PRE>
        rm -f /opt/kde/share/applnk/Utilities/battery.kdelnk
        rm -f /opt/kde/bin/battery
        rm -rf /opt/kde/share/apps/battery
