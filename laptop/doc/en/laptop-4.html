<H2><A NAME="s4">4. The Battery Warning and Critical Panels</A></H2>

<P>These tabs group together the options that control what happen when a
pre-determined battery low condition occurs. There are two of them so that you can 
set a warning for when time is getting close, and something more deperate
for that last minute save or suspend.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Low trigger</A>
</H2>

<P>This field specifies at which point the battery low state is detected - it
is the number of minutes left (according to APM) in your batteries. When this
number is crossed the low state is triggered and one or more of the following things will occur
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Run Command</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a shell command that will be executed when the battery low is detected. 
By default, this is turned off.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Play Sound</A>
</H2>

<P>This specifies a sound to play when battery low is detected. As of this version,
it will only play .wav files. Simply specify the path to the file to have
it played. By default, this is turned off.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 System Beep</A>
</H2>

<P>Enabling this will cause Battery to beep whenever the battery level drops below
the preset value. This is
probably the least intrusive, yet still active, method of alerting the user
that the battery is low. By default, this is on.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Notify</A>
</H2>

<P>Enabling this will cause Battery to popup a window when the battery becomes low. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Suspend</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have set up /usr/bin/apm to be run setuid (see the instructions for the 'Power' panel)
then this check box will appear - if checked it will cause your computer to be put into 
'Suspend' mode.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 Standby</A>
</H2>

<P>Like 'Suspend' above but it puts your computer into 'Standby' mode.
